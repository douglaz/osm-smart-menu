# OSM Smart Menu
OpenStreetMap helper extension compatible with the [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/addon/osm-smart-menu/), [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/osm-smart-menu/icipmdhgbkejfideagkhdebiaeohfijk?authuser=2) and Opera browsers.

## Contributing

### Translations
Add a file called `messages.json` in the folder `_locales/xy/`, where `xy` is your languages' code.
You just need to translate the messages that are different from the default values (in this case, values from the english translation).
Feel free to create regional tranlations adding the country code after the language code.
See [Chrome's documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/i18n) for details.

### Adding new websites
1. Add an entry in `lib/sites-configuration.js` following a schema similar to the others (will be documented in the future);
2. Add an entry for it's name translation in the default i18n file (`_locales/en/messages.json`) and for other languages you know;
3. If possible, add in `lib/background/injectable-content-script.js` a function for getting permalinks or some additional data from the website that is not extractable from the URL.

I reserve the right of refusing to add a website to the extension for any reason.
In the future, I plan to find a way to allow the users to add their own websites.
